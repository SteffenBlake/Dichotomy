## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteffenBlake/Dichotomy.git
   cd Dichotomy
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build the HTML from markdown:
   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your web browser or serve locally:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys your site when you push to the `main` branch.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
4. Push changes to the `main` branch, and the workflow will automatically:
   - Build the HTML from `content.md`
   - Apply cache busting to CSS
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
5. Your site will be published at `https://steffenblake.github.io/Dichotomy/`

## Customization

### Update Content

Edit `content.md` to customize your documentation:
- Use `#` for top-level sections
- Use `##` for subsections
- Use `###` for sub-subsections
- The table of contents will be automatically generated from these headers

Example:
```markdown

## File Structure

```
Dichotomy/
├── content.md              # Markdown source file
├── build.py                # Build script to generate HTML
├── index.html              # Generated HTML file (auto-generated)
├── styles.css              # CSS stylesheet
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow
└── README.md               # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Content**: Write your documentation in `content.md` using standard markdown
2. **Build**: Run `build.py` to convert markdown to HTML with automatic TOC generation
3. **Deploy**: GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys on push to main
4. **Cache Busting**: CSS files get a unique hash to prevent caching issues
